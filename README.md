## Product Explanation

LinguAI is a language learning app designed to help people learn in natural environments and authentic materials! 
It provides an alive dictionary reinforced with AI, letting you scan whatever item in front of you and get immediate results in any language you desire

Community is everything when you are trying to learn any language because languages are alive just like us. Since we mostly learn more when we give the wrong answers, it is vital to have friends to practice and have fun with!
 
It also allows you to keep track of what you have learned so far and helps you gain better understanding by creating language games based on your content. This way you can truly practice and also learn more with others. Challanging! 



- **Main Function** 

- The major feature of our app is the live dictionary using AI. We believe it could help a lot in language learning since it will be used in the most natural and authentic way possible. No one would look for the meanings of some words on their own just to learn them or read dictionaries like people used to! Thanks to ever evolving technology, now you get to have fun with it as well!

 

- **Secondary Function**

- The second feature we have and consider vital in a language learning app is playing interactive games. It helps you to think in the moment and not memorize! It also allows to keep your pace of learning in snyc with what you have already learned. 

## Product Details 
 
 A real time dictionary using your camera, designed and powered by AI. You could capture it with your camera and get immediate results in multiple languages. 

 A mental lexicon where you could save the words you looked up and save them in the app, gradually creating your own reality around the target language. 

 Users could play games against one another and the content of the game is created through the progress they made. AI working for you to create best possible games, slightly making it harder for you, facilitating the learning process.

# Sprint 1

- **Estimated points to be assigned**:
- 100 Points


- **Point Reasoning**:
- We decided that the first sprint should hold 100 points worth of tasks.
  

- **Daily Scrum**:
- Daily Scrum meetings are held at night on Discord due to time restrictions of the team. We have saved and collected meeting notes and also created different channels for idea sharing and off topic questions.

- **Product Situation**:

- 
  
- **Sprint Review**: 

We have lost much time trying to set a convinient time for everyone. So we decided that we should work on broader tasks and share them evenly, assigning everyone to tasks they are more prone to or ready to deal with. We figured we should have 3 different main tasks to lead the way and the rest can be assigned depending on the current situation.

These were app design, Firebase and AI. We created the Firebase database design, tried out different pre trained AI models for our cause and redesigned the template to serve our needs simultaneously. We updated the tasks we have on Jira board when we made progress, keeping it alive with screenshots and images. 



- **Sprint Retrospective:**
  - We have decided that we should be working in duos and constantly share our progress with each other.
  - Daily meetings are decided to be held at night.
  - Personal task sharing is encouraged.
